        Human neuroimaging converts continuous physical properties of the brain into discrete
        digital numbers. Three mathematical pillars underpin this translation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Discrete spatial representation</strong> — pixels (2D) and voxels (3D).</li>
        <li><strong>Linear algebra</strong> — scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency analysis</strong> — Fourier transforms linking time/space and frequency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        MRI, fMRI, diffusion imaging, and PET all rely on these tools to reconstruct images,
        quantify changes across time, and model complex experimental designs.

        Conceptual pipeline illustrating how continuous brain anatomy is sampled and digitized
        into physical signals, discretized into pixels and voxels, organized into vectors,
        matrices, and tensors, and transformed using Fourier-based methods for reconstruction
        and analysis. Adapted and reimagined from
        <em>Bolding, NBL&nbsp;625 Lecture&nbsp;1</em>.

    <strong>Why these foundations matter</strong><br />
    These choices are not neutral: how we discretize space, represent data, and transform signals
    governs which neural effects are visible, which artifacts appear, and how we interpret
    “activation” or structural differences.
